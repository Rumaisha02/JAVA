"=="   for checking strings checks on object level..this means that it not only checks the value stores but also that the variable 
points to the same address in memory 

".equals()"    checks only if the value of stores is equal or not

".substring(startIndex,endingIndex)"  ending index excluded..this fucntion returns that specific part of string between these indexes 
".compareTo()" function compares two strings lexicographicaly 


STRING BUILDER
used as strings are immutable and have alot time complexity so to handle that, we've got String BUILDER
syntax: StingBuilder sb= new StingBuilder("String"); now we can do as many changes as we want in this sb 
*Sting builder is not a String type.. and it can be changed to String using .toString() function
we can change almost any type to string but it should be Object ..for example- 
int a=45; a.toString() ❌ will not work as int is not an object,whereas
Integer a=45; a.toString()✅ will change to string type ...same for every other object
